# The Impact of Screen Time on Mental Health Across Different Age Groups

## Abstract

This project looks at how screen time might impact mental health, specifically focusing on symptoms like anxiety, stress, and depression across different age groups. With screen use being such a big part of everyday life, it’s useful to understand if certain types of screen activities, like social media or gaming, have different effects on mental health depending on age.

We’ll be using the **Mental Health and Technology Usage** dataset from Kaggle, which includes self-reported data on screen habits, mental health symptoms, and demographic information. The dataset is publicly available under the Apache 2.0 License and can be accessed here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/mental-health-and-technology-usage-dataset.

## Research Goals and Questions
The project aims to:
- Examine how screen time relates to mental health outcomes, like anxiety and stress, across age groups.
- Explore if certain types of screen activities, such as social media or gaming, have a stronger link to mental health issues.
- Find out if some age groups are more affected by screen time than others when it comes to mental health.

## Methods

To analyze these relationships, I’ll utilize visual tools like bar charts, scatter plots, and tables to help show patterns in the data.

## Significance

The results could offer insights into how screen time affects mental health differently depending on age and screen activity type. This could help guide recommendations for healthier screen habits and contribute to discussions around mental health and technology use.
