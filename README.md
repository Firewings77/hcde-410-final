# The Impact of Screen Time on Mental Health

## Abstract

This study explores how screen time affects mental health, focusing on stress and overall mental health status across age groups and genders. Using the [Mental Health and Technology Usage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/mental-health-and-technology-usage-dataset) from Kaggle, I analyzed relationships between technology usage, specific activities (social media, gaming), and mental health indicators. The dataset includes self-reported data on screen habits, stress levels, and demographic details like age and gender.

The findings reveal that teenagers experience higher stress levels with increased screen time compared to other age groups. Social media usage is more strongly associated with poor mental health than gaming, while gender differences indicate that women report slightly higher stress and screen usage levels than men. These insights contribute to understanding how technology impacts mental health and provide actionable recommendations for healthier screen habits tailored to specific demographics.

The study highlights the importance of human-centered approaches in addressing technology’s role in mental health and identifies key areas for future research, including more diverse datasets and longitudinal analysis.

## Research Goals and Questions

This project aims to address the following questions:
1. **Primary Question:** How does screen time correlate with self-reported mental health indicators (e.g., stress) across different age groups?
2. **Secondary Questions:**
   - Are specific screen time activities (e.g., social media, gaming) more strongly associated with negative mental health outcomes?
   - How do mental health outcomes and technology usage differ based on gender?

## Methods

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Removed invalid or missing values from key columns such as `Age`, `Screen_Time_Hours`, and `Stress_Level`.
- Segmented data into relevant groups (e.g., age groups and screen activity types).
- Converted categorical variables, such as `Mental_Health_Status` and `Gender`, into numerical or ordered formats for analysis.

### Data Analysis
- Conducted descriptive analysis to explore the distribution of screen time and mental health indicators.
- Applied correlation analysis to evaluate relationships between variables.
- Created visualizations, including:
  - Scatter plots to analyze relationships between screen time and stress levels.
  - Box plots to compare social media and gaming usage across mental health statuses.
  - Bar plots to compare technology usage across mental health statuses by gender.

## Visualizations

- **Scatter Plot:** Shows the correlation between screen time and stress levels across age groups.
- **Comparison Box Plot:** Highlights differences in social media and gaming usage by mental health status.
- **Bar Plot:** Demonstrates variations in technology usage by gender and mental health status.

=======
To analyze these relationships, I’ll utilize visual tools like bar charts, scatter plots, and tables to help show patterns in the data.

## Significance

Understanding how screen time influences mental health across different demographics provides actionable insights:
- Informing recommendations for healthier screen habits.
- Identifying groups that may require tailored interventions or guidelines.
- Contributing to the broader discourse on technology's role in mental health.

The findings aim to assist mental health practitioners, researchers, and policymakers in addressing the challenges posed by technology usage in a human-centered manner.
